# IDS721 Project 3

### **Cloud-based Big Data Systems for Indian Flight Price Visualize & Prediction Model Fit**

#### About

In this project, flight price in Indian market is visualized and the Prediction Model is fit in AWS Sagemaker Cloud-based Big Data Systems.

My AWS Sagemaker instance is showed as above:

It is a ml.t3.medium instance based on Amazon Linux 2, Jupyter Lab 3. 

In this project, I did following:

1. Pre-process the dataset
2. Analyze and visualize dataset
3. Create, educate, and optimize some machine learning models.
4. Recognize partiality in machine learning models and grasp the predictions made by the model.
5. Compare the effective of different machine learning models.

The project endpoint report is deployed on EC2 Server.
